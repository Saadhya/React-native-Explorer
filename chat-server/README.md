# chat server
- npm init -y

# type=module
- here we are gonna change type = module in package.json as that allows us to import syntax in the server instead of require.
- add the start script = node index.js
- initialize server with new operator
- cors is a security feature that would essentially prevent you from sending the request to the server from the client if both are on the same computer
